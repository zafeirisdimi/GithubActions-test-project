- What kind of language is this yml file?

YAML is a digestible data serialization language often used to create configuration files with any programming language.

Designed for human interaction, YAML is a strict superset of JSON, another data serialization language. But because itâ€™s a strict superset, it can do everything that JSON can and more. One major difference is that newlines and indentation actually mean something in YAML, as opposed to JSON, which uses brackets and braces.
